1. What is a hash function and what are some structure/strategies for implementing them?

-Hash function is mathematical function or a process, which transform a huge, possibly
variable-sized amount of data into a small, usually fixed-sized.

-Hashing is a procedure that is used in sorting and retrieving the information about the
database. 
-Hashing is a good technique for implementation in keyed tables.
-hashing the transformation of a string of characters into a frequently shorter fixedlength
value or key that represents the original string is done.

* Division Method
	-an integer key is divided by the table size and the remainder is taken as the hash value.
	103 % 10(size of table) = 3;  table: 0-9; inserted to address 3;  ex: "Cat" = ASCII 13110;
	13110 % 10 = 0; 'Cat' inserted to address 0;

* Multiplication Method
	-Multiply all the digits in the key, and then mod(%) the table size; get the reminder.
	ex: 'Cat' = 131130; (1 * 3 * 1 * 1 * 3 * 0) % 10 = 0; address 0;

* Folding Method
	-breaks up key into segaments, add them up, then mod(%) by table size; 3 segments;
	ex: 123456789; a=123, b=456, c=789; (123 + 456 + 789) % 3 = 1368 % 10 = 8; 
		address 8;

Hashing strategies:
	- Universal Hashing, Hashing with Polynomials,  Cascade Hashing, Geometric Hashing;

Problems:
	-collision: 2 diff inputs, results in same output;


2. What is a garbage collection? (bonus points for relating it to Java and C#)

-In java, garbage means unreferenced objects.
Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.
in java it is performed automatically

3. What do you know about data structures and working with them?

-In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
-the most common used datastructure is an array. which you access by integer indexes. and usually fixed size;
-there is LinkedList: it connects to the adjacent nodes, and can efficiently perform insertion and deletion, without going through the rest of the list.
-hashtable: effecient for implementing things like a dictionary. Mapping keys to the value. effecient to look up large amount of datas, using fixed amount of keys in the table. 
-choose to optimize the runtime, and space.
